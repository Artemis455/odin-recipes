    <img src="../images/zucchini.webp" alt="Mediterranean Stuffed Zucchini">
    <p>Here's a delicious way to solve the problem of those too-big zucchini ballooning in your garden at the end of the summer: zucchini boats 
        baked and stuffed with lamb, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes, and other Mediterranean flavors!</p>


    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>coarse salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the 
        zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. 
        Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
         Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, 
        and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. </p>
